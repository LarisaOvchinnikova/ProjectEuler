Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

def fib():
  f0 = 1
  f1 = 2
  s = f1
  f = 0
  while f < 4000000:
    if f % 2 == 0:
      s += f
    f = f0 + f1
    f0 = f1
    f1 = f
  return s

print(fib())
